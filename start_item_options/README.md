# Start Item Options

This mod adds four initial items options to choose from in the starting room. Because of this, the treasure room of the first level is always empty. Although, when the level has the 'Curse Of Labyrinth', the second entered treasure room will be always be the empty one.

Originally based on [There's A Bit More Options at the Start!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2444327747), this mod was created for personal use, but decided later on to make it public. It was created from ground zero to fix the issues that the original mod had, and added some improvements.

These are some of the improvements:

* Planetarium chance properly updates when picking up or skipping the item.
* In XL floors, the first item room has the item, but the second entered one does not.
* Fixes items being removed from item rooms.
