# Lemegeton Wisp Count

This mod adds a counter with the number of wisps spawned by the Lemegeton active item. When multiple characters are present, he wisp icon color will change and a small number will be shown to indicate to whom belongs the wisps.

The counter does not show unless a character has the Lemegeton, or owns a wisp of the Lemegeton item.
